Created By: Ruchy Brach

## Overview
 This repo is for the software implementation of the game of Pyramid.
This Software will allow the player to build words on a specific letter of the alphabet. A description of the game including the requirements of this implementation are provided below. 

## The Game
 The pyramid consists of 5 layers. The first layer has one textbox, the second layer has two textboxes, the third layer has 3 textboxes, and so on...
The player will be presented with one letter of the alphabet on the upper most textbox of the pyramid. The player will then write a new word in the next layer while including all of the letter(s) from the previous layer.
When all five layers are completed the player's score will go up and the player will be presented with a new pyramid. If the score is the highest the player ever reached, the score will be recorded in the "Best Played" Textbox. 

The full spec for the game is in the repo.
